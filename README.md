# NLPJuMPModels

This package provides nonlinear programming models as implemented by
[NLPModels](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl), through the use of
[JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl).

See the documentation on NLPModels for the general description of NLPModels. Here, we
focus on the use of JuMP to create these.

## NLPModels from a JuMP

NLPJuMPModels provides conversion between MathProgBase models and NLPModels.
